# Daily Coding 724

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a binary tree. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of `+`, `−`, `∗`, or `/`.

Given the root to such a tree, write a function to evaluate it.

For example, given the following tree:

```

     '+'
   /    \
 '*'     '-'
 / \    /    \
5  4    100   '/'
             /   \
            20    2
``` 

You should return 110;
